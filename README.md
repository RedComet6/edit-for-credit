## Description

This is a Progressive Web App text editor. When a user runs "npm run start" from the command line in the root directory, a bundle is created in the "dist" folder that includes bundled javascript, an index.html, bundled CSS, a service worker, and a manifest file; after the bundle is created, the app begins running. The app immediately creates an IndexedDB storage database, and a user may enter any content they wish and save it to the IndexedDB by clicking in the window. If a user closes and reopens the app, the data stored in IndexedDB is retried and automatically populated into the editing area. When a user clicks the "Install" button, they will download the app as an icon on their desktop. When a user loads the application, they will have a service worker registered using workbox. This service worker precaches static assets for the user.
